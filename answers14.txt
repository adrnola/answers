Monitoring Amazon Managed Grafana (AMG) involves tracking specific CloudWatch metrics and setting up corresponding alarms to ensure the service operates smoothly. AMG automatically publishes several key metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, which you can use to monitor the health and performance of your Grafana workspaces.

Key CloudWatch Metrics for AMG:

UserLoginsCount: Tracks the number of user logins to your Grafana workspace. Monitoring this metric helps you understand user engagement and detect unusual login patterns.

DashboardLoadTime: Measures the time taken to load dashboards within your Grafana workspace. High values may indicate performance issues that need attention.

DataSourceErrorCount: Counts the number of errors encountered when querying data sources. An increase in this metric could signify issues with data source configurations or connectivity.

ActiveUsers: Indicates the number of active users in your Grafana workspace over a specified period. This metric helps in assessing user activity and resource utilization.

Recommended Alarms:

High Dashboard Load Time: Set an alarm to trigger if the DashboardLoadTime exceeds a predefined threshold, indicating potential performance bottlenecks.

Elevated Data Source Errors: Configure an alarm for when the DataSourceErrorCount surpasses a certain limit, suggesting issues with data retrieval from sources.

Unusual Login Activity: Establish an alarm to detect significant deviations in the UserLoginsCount, which could point to unauthorized access attempts or other security concerns.

By actively monitoring these metrics and setting up appropriate alarms, you can maintain the reliability and performance of your Amazon Managed Grafana service.




What AWS IAM roles are needed to interact with the AWS Managed Grafana (AMG)

To interact with Amazon Managed Grafana (AMG), specific AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions are required depending on the type of interaction (e.g., administering AMG, using the service, or integrating it with other AWS services). Here's a breakdown of the roles and their purposes:

1. AWS Service-Linked Role for AMG
Purpose: Enables AMG to manage resources on your behalf.

Role Name: AWSServiceRoleForAmazonManagedGrafana
Managed Policy: Automatically attached by AWS.
Description: Required for AMG to manage its internal configurations, such as integrating with data sources, managing workspaces, and enabling integrations.
Actions Allowed:
iam:PassRole
cloudwatch:*
xray:* (if enabled for tracing)
Various permissions for supported AWS data sources like CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Athena.
Setup: Automatically created when you create an AMG workspace.

2. IAM Role for Workspace Authentication
Purpose: Allows AMG workspaces to authenticate and access integrated AWS services (like CloudWatch, X-Ray, etc.).

Example Role Name: AmazonManagedGrafanaWorkspaceAccessRole
Permissions Required:
sts:AssumeRole: Required by AMG to assume this role.
Service-specific permissions for the services you want to integrate:
For CloudWatch:
cloudwatch:ListMetrics
cloudwatch:GetMetricData
cloudwatch:GetDashboard
For X-Ray:
xray:GetTraceSummaries
xray:GetServiceGraph
For AWS IoT:
iot:GetThingShadow
iot:DescribeThing
For Athena:
athena:StartQueryExecution
athena:GetQueryResults
3. IAM Role for SSO Integration
Purpose: Grants AMG permission to integrate with Identity Providers (IdPs) for Single Sign-On (SSO).

Role Name: Custom-defined based on your IdP integration.
Permissions:
For AWS SSO:
sso:DescribePermissionSets
sso:ListPermissionSetsProvisionedToAccount
sso:GetRoleCredentials
For custom IdPs:
Permissions vary based on the IdP and authentication method.
4. Admin or Workspace Management Role
Purpose: For users managing AMG workspaces or administering the service.

Example Role Name: GrafanaAdminRole
Permissions:
grafana:CreateWorkspace
grafana:DeleteWorkspace
grafana:UpdateWorkspace
grafana:DescribeWorkspace
grafana:ListWorkspaces
iam:PassRole (to pass roles for AMG to assume)
5. End-User Role for AMG Workspaces
Purpose: Allows end-users to log in and interact with Grafana workspaces.

Permissions: Managed by the workspace itself and controlled via AMG's user management.
Integration: Typically linked to SSO or IAM Identity Center for user access.
Additional Notes:
Least Privilege Principle: Always assign the minimum set of permissions necessary for a role.
Fine-Grained Data Source Access: Create IAM policies with service-specific permissions to control which AWS resources are accessible through Grafana dashboards.
Service Limits: Ensure AMG is within the service quotas for workspaces and integrations.
For detailed steps to create and attach these roles, consult the AWS Documentation on AMG Permissions.
