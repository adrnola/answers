What is the AWS Managed Grafana (AMG) pricing model?

ChatGPT
Amazon Managed Grafana (AMG) offers a flexible, pay-as-you-go pricing model based on active user licenses per workspace. Here's an overview of the pricing structure:

User License Types and Costs:

Editor or Administrator License: $9 per active user per workspace per month. These users have permissions to manage workspaces, create and edit dashboards, and configure alerts.

Viewer License: $5 per active user per workspace per month. Viewers have read-only access to dashboards and data sources.

An "active user" is defined as someone who logs into an AMG workspace or makes an API request at least once during a monthly billing cycle. If a user is granted access but does not log in during the month, they are not billed for that period. 
AWS

API User Licenses:

Administrator or Editor API User License: $9 per active API user per workspace per month.

Viewer API User License: $5 per active API user per workspace per month.

If multiple API keys with different permissions are associated with one API user license, the higher price applies. 
AWS

Enterprise Plugins and Support:

For access to Enterprise Plugins that connect to third-party data sources like AppDynamics, Datadog, and Splunk, AMG offers an Enterprise Plugins license:

Enterprise Plugins License: An additional $45 per active user per workspace per month. This upgrade also includes support and on-demand training directly from Grafana Labs. 
AWS
Free Trial:

AMG provides a 90-day free trial, allowing up to five active users per account. Usage beyond these five users during the trial period is billed at the standard rates mentioned above. 
AWS

Minimum Charges:

Each workspace requires at least one Editor license to manage and log into the workspace, even if no users log in during the month. This ensures that there's always an administrator available to manage the workspace.

Technically explain how AWS Managed Grafana (AMG) using an AWS DevOps Account retrieves AWS Cloudwatch data and AWS X-Ray metrics from an AWS Workload Account?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
AWS Managed Grafana (AMG) can securely retrieve CloudWatch and X-Ray metrics from separate AWS accounts, such as an AWS Workload Account, using cross-account roles and resource-based policies. Here’s a technical breakdown of how this process works when AMG is hosted in an AWS DevOps Account, and the workload metrics are in a different AWS Workload Account.

1. Setting up Cross-Account Access
To enable AMG to access resources in another AWS account (Workload Account), AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles are used.

Role in Workload Account: An IAM role is created in the AWS Workload Account with permissions to access AWS CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray metrics. This role must be assumable by AMG running in the AWS DevOps Account.

IAM Trust Policy: The IAM role in the Workload Account includes a trust policy allowing it to be assumed by a role or principal in the DevOps Account. Specifically, it grants permission to the grafana.amazonaws.com service principal in the DevOps Account.

Permissions Policy: The role in the Workload Account is attached to a policy that provides the necessary permissions to retrieve data from CloudWatch (cloudwatch:GetMetricData, cloudwatch:ListMetrics) and X-Ray (xray:GetServiceGraph, xray:GetTraceSummaries, etc.).

2. Configuration in AWS Managed Grafana (AMG)
Setting up the Data Source in AMG: In the AWS DevOps Account, within AMG, you set up Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray as data sources. AMG requires configuration to specify which AWS accounts to pull data from, including the AWS Workload Account ID.

Assuming the Role in the Workload Account: AMG in the DevOps Account can be configured to assume the role in the Workload Account to retrieve metrics. AMG will use the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to assume the IAM role in the Workload Account, effectively granting it the permissions assigned to that role.

3. Retrieving CloudWatch Metrics
Once the cross-account role is established and AMG is configured to assume it, AMG can retrieve metrics as follows:

Metric Queries: When a user queries CloudWatch metrics in AMG (e.g., creating a dashboard or setting alerts), AMG uses the assumed role to access CloudWatch in the Workload Account.

Data Transmission: The requested CloudWatch metrics are then securely transmitted back to AMG for visualization and analysis.

4. Retrieving AWS X-Ray Metrics
Similarly, AMG can query AWS X-Ray metrics from the Workload Account:

Trace and Service Graph Requests: AMG can make API calls using the assumed role to retrieve trace summaries, service graphs, and specific trace data from X-Ray in the Workload Account.

Visualizing Traces and Service Maps: These X-Ray metrics are then rendered within AMG, allowing DevOps engineers to analyze service performance and latency across their workload applications.

Summary
The technical flow involves:

Creating a cross-account IAM role in the Workload Account with permissions to access CloudWatch and X-Ray metrics.
Configuring AMG to assume the IAM role in the Workload Account.
Using AWS STS for secure cross-account access, allowing AMG to retrieve and visualize metrics from the workload resources.
By securely configuring IAM roles and leveraging AWS STS, AMG in an AWS DevOps Account can retrieve and display CloudWatch and X-Ray metrics from a separate AWS Workload Account in a manner that adheres to AWS’s security best practices.
