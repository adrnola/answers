AWS CodePipeline offers a flexible pricing model based on the type of pipeline you choose:

V1-Type Pipelines:

Cost: $1.00 per active pipeline per month. 
AWS

Definition of Active Pipeline: A pipeline that has existed for more than 30 days and has at least one code change running through it during the month. Pipelines with no new code changes during the month incur no charge. The active pipeline fee is not prorated for partial months. 
AWS

Free Tier: One active pipeline per month is free for new and existing customers. 
AWS

V2-Type Pipelines:

Cost: $0.002 per action execution minute. The duration is calculated from the start to the completion of an action, rounded up to the nearest minute. Charges apply to all action types except for manual approval and custom action types. 
AWS

Free Tier: 100 action execution minutes per month are free, shared across all V2 pipelines in the account. Unused minutes do not carry over to the next month. 
AWS

Additional Charges:

You may incur extra costs for:

Storing and accessing pipeline artifacts in Amazon S3.

Triggering actions from other AWS services or third-party integrations connected to your pipeline.

AWS CodePipeline provides several metric dimensions that you can use with Amazon CloudWatch to monitor pipeline activity. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key dimensions associated with AWS CodePipeline metrics:

1. Pipeline Name:
Dimension Name: PipelineName
Description: Specifies the name of the pipeline you want to monitor. Using this dimension, you can focus on metrics related to a specific pipeline.
2. Stage Name:
Dimension Name: StageName
Description: Specifies the name of the stage within a pipeline. This dimension is useful for monitoring metrics at the stage level (e.g., stage execution duration or status).
3. Action Name:
Dimension Name: ActionName
Description: Specifies the name of the action within a stage. This allows for detailed monitoring of individual actions, such as deployment, build, or test actions.
4. Execution ID:
Dimension Name: ExecutionId
Description: Unique identifier for a specific execution of a pipeline. Useful for tracking and correlating metrics across multiple stages and actions within a single pipeline execution.
5. Pipeline and Stage Metrics (Combined):
PipelineName, StageName: Use both dimensions together to get metrics specific to stages within a particular pipeline.
PipelineName, ActionName: Use these together to monitor specific actions within a pipeline.
PipelineName, ExecutionId: Enables tracking of metrics for a specific execution run of the pipeline.
These dimensions allow you to customize and fine-tune your monitoring setup for AWS CodePipeline, giving you granular control over the metrics you need at the pipeline, stage, action, and execution levels.
