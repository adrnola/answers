Provide an IAM role with least privilege for CDK so that it can bootstrap an AWS Account only the following Accounts can be bootstrapped by CDK: DevOps, Dev, SIT, Prep

To restrict AWS CDK bootstrapping to specific accounts (e.g., DevOps, Dev, SIT, and Prep), the IAM role needs to implement conditions using the aws:ResourceAccount key. This ensures that the resources created during the CDK bootstrap process are scoped to only the allowed accounts.

Below is an example IAM role with least privilege that allows CDK to bootstrap AWS accounts, while restricting actions to the specified accounts.

Policy Explanation
CloudFormation Permissions (AllowCloudFormationBootstrapForSpecificAccounts):

Grants permissions for CDK to manage the CDKToolkit stack, but only for the specified AWS accounts.
S3 Permissions (AllowS3AccessForBootstrap):

Allows CDK to manage S3 buckets used for storing deployment artifacts, scoped to buckets within the specified accounts.
IAM Permissions (AllowIAMRoleAndPolicyManagementForSpecificAccounts):

Enables the creation and management of IAM roles and policies required during CDK bootstrap, restricted to roles and resources in the allowed accounts.
KMS Permissions (AllowKMSKeyManagementForSpecificAccounts):

Allows managing KMS keys created during bootstrapping, scoped to the specified accounts.
SSM Parameter Store Permissions (AllowSSMParameterStoreAccessForSpecificAccounts):

Enables storing bootstrap-related parameters securely in the Systems Manager Parameter Store, limited to the allowed accounts.
Steps to Implement
Create the IAM Role:

Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or Infrastructure as Code (e.g., CDK, CloudFormation) to create the role.
Attach this policy to the role.
Set the Trust Relationship:

Configure the trust relationship to allow the appropriate entity (e.g., a user, role, or service) to assume this role. Example trust policy:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/CDKUser"  // Replace with user/service ARN
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
Run the Bootstrap Command:
Specify the role and accounts during the CDK bootstrap process:
bash
Copy code
cdk bootstrap --trust 111122223333 --trust 444455556666 --trust 777788889999 --trust 000011112222 --cloudformation-execution-policies arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
Security Considerations
Replace * in Resource where feasible with specific ARNs for tighter access control.
Regularly review IAM policies to ensure compliance with least privilege principles.
Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing role usage.
This policy ensures that CDK bootstrap operations are scoped to specific accounts while maintaining the least privilege necessary for the process.




what AWS KMS keys are created during CDK Bootstrapping ?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
During AWS CDK bootstrapping, a KMS key is created to secure assets and deployment metadata used in the CDK workflow. Here's a detailed explanation of the KMS key created during the process:

KMS Key Created During CDK Bootstrapping
Key Name and Purpose

Key Alias: alias/cdk/cfn-exporter (default alias for the key created by the CDK bootstrap process).
Purpose: This key is used to encrypt files and assets stored in the S3 bucket created during bootstrapping. These assets include:
Lambda function code.
Docker container images.
Other deployment metadata.
Key Type

The KMS key is a Customer Managed Key (CMK).
It supports key rotation and full control by the customer for enhanced security.
Key Usage

Encryption and Decryption: Ensures the confidentiality of deployment artifacts stored in the S3 bucket.
Resources such as S3 buckets and related objects are encrypted with this KMS key.
How the KMS Key is Used
CDK Deployment Assets:

During deployment, assets (e.g., Lambda code, static files, Docker images) are uploaded to the S3 bucket created during bootstrapping.
These assets are encrypted using the KMS key.
Cross-Account Sharing (Optional):

If the CDK is set up for cross-account deployment, the KMS key is shared across the trusted accounts to allow them to decrypt the shared assets.
Key Management
Default Configuration:
AWS CDK automatically creates this KMS key during bootstrapping, and it is managed by AWS unless customized.
Customizing the KMS Key:
You can override the default key creation and specify your own key using the --bootstrap-kms-key option in the bootstrap command:
bash
Copy code
cdk bootstrap --bootstrap-kms-key arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id
This is useful if you want to use an existing KMS key or customize key policies.
KMS Key Policies
The key policy grants the required permissions to:

IAM Roles and Principals:
Permissions are given to the roles created during the bootstrapping process.
Trusted Accounts (Optional):
If cross-account access is configured, the policy includes permissions for trusted AWS accounts.
Example KMS Key Policy
Below is a typical key policy for the KMS key created during bootstrapping:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "cdk-bootstrap-kms-key-policy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "EnableKeyUsageForS3AndIAMRoles",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/cdk-*",
          "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/AdminRole"  // Example: Admin role used in deployments
        ]
      },
      "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCrossAccountAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::trusted-account-id:role/cdk-*"
        ]
      },
      "Action": [
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
How to View the Created KMS Key
Go to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
Look for a key with the alias alias/cdk/cfn-exporter or a similar alias configured during bootstrapping.
Considerations
Key Costs:
KMS keys incur additional costs for creation, usage, and key rotation. Ensure this aligns with your budget.
Custom Key Policies:
Modify the key policy if stricter control is required.
Cross-Account Usage:
Properly configure the key for multi-account setups by granting permissions to trusted accounts.
Conclusion
During CDK bootstrapping, a KMS key (default alias alias/cdk/cfn-exporter) is created to encrypt deployment assets stored in S3. This key ensures security and supports multi-account deployments if necessary. You can customize the key or its policies during the bootstrap process for advanced use cases.
