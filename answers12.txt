ChatGPT
When using Amazon EventBridge, specific IAM roles and service roles are required to facilitate secure and proper interaction with other AWS services. Below is a guide to the roles needed for various EventBridge functionalities:

1. IAM Role for EventBridge Rules
EventBridge rules may invoke other AWS services (e.g., Lambda, ECS, Step Functions). These rules require an execution role with permissions to access the target services.

Example Use Case:
Triggering an AWS Lambda function
Sending a message to an SQS queue or SNS topic
Starting an ECS task
Required Permissions:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "lambda:InvokeFunction",
        "ecs:RunTask",
        "sns:Publish",
        "sqs:SendMessage",
        "states:StartExecution"
      ],
      "Resource": "<Target Resource ARN>"
    }
  ]
}
Best Practices:
Use the principle of least privilege: Grant only the actions and resources needed for the rule's targets.
Use condition keys where possible, such as aws:SourceArn to restrict permissions to specific EventBridge rules.
2. IAM Role for Custom Event Bus Permissions
To allow other AWS accounts or services to send events to your custom EventBridge event bus, you need to set up a resource-based policy.

Example Resource-Based Policy for Event Bus:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "events:PutEvents",
      "Resource": "<Event Bus ARN>",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "events:Source": "<Source>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
Best Practices:
Limit permissions to trusted accounts or services.
Use the events:Source condition key to restrict event sources.
3. IAM Role for EventBridge Archive and Replay
If you use event archiving and replay, EventBridge requires access to an Amazon S3 bucket for storing events.

Required Permissions:
Grant EventBridge permissions to put and get objects in the designated S3 bucket:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "<S3 Bucket ARN>",
        "<S3 Bucket Object ARN>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
4. Service-Linked Role for EventBridge Scheduler
When using EventBridge Scheduler to run scheduled tasks or trigger services, AWS automatically creates a service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForEventBridgeScheduler.

Managed Role Name:
AWSServiceRoleForEventBridgeScheduler

Role Permissions:
This role provides EventBridge Scheduler access to AWS services like Lambda, ECS, and Step Functions. The permissions cannot be edited directly but are managed by AWS.

5. IAM Role for Dead-Letter Queues (DLQ)
If an EventBridge rule uses a DLQ (e.g., Amazon SQS), an IAM role is required to allow EventBridge to write failed events to the queue.

Required Permissions:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "<DLQ ARN>"
    }
  ]
}
6. IAM Role for Cross-Account Event Delivery
To enable cross-account event delivery between EventBridge event buses in different AWS accounts, configure a trust relationship.

Required Permissions:
Event Bus Account (Receiving Account):

Update the event bus resource policy to allow events:PutEvents from the sender account.
Sender Account:

Create an IAM role with permissions to send events:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "events:PutEvents",
      "Resource": "<Receiver Event Bus ARN>"
    }
  ]
}
Trust Relationship for IAM Role:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "<Sender Account ID>"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
7. EventBridge to AWS Organizations Integration
If you're using EventBridge to manage events across AWS Organizations, additional permissions are required to allow access to organization events.

Required Permissions:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "organizations:DescribeOrganization",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Best Practices for IAM Roles in EventBridge:
Use Role Chaining for Secure Access: When triggering cross-account events, use IAM roles with clearly defined trust relationships.
Rotate IAM Keys: If roles are associated with programmatic access, enforce key rotation.
Enable Logging: Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor role usage and EventBridge API calls.
Enforce Scoped Permissions: Grant access only to specific resources (e.g., event bus ARNs, S3 buckets).
By following these guidelines, you can ensure secure, efficient role configurations for AWS EventBridge.
