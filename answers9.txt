Accessing an AWS VPC Endpoint in a SharedServices AWS account from a DevOps AWS account involves setting up cross-account access through AWS PrivateLink. Here's how you can achieve this:

Steps to Access a Shared VPC Endpoint
1. Create the VPC Endpoint in the SharedServices Account
In the SharedServices AWS account:
Create a VPC Endpoint (an Interface Endpoint) in the relevant VPC.
Associate the endpoint with subnets in the VPC where your resources reside.
Ensure the security group for the endpoint allows inbound traffic from the DevOps VPC.
2. Create a PrivateLink Service in SharedServices
In the SharedServices account, expose the endpoint as a VPC Endpoint Service:
Go to VPC > Endpoint Services.
Create a new Endpoint Service and associate it with the Network Load Balancer (NLB) or service running in the VPC.
Enable Allow principals and specify the DevOps account ID to allow access.
3. Create a VPC Endpoint in the DevOps Account
In the DevOps AWS account:
Go to VPC > Endpoints.
Create a new Interface Endpoint.
Specify the Service Name of the VPC Endpoint Service in the SharedServices account. The Service Name is typically in the format:
php
Copy code
com.amazonaws.vpce.<region>.vpce-svc-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Choose the subnets and security groups to associate with this endpoint in the DevOps VPC.
4. Configure DNS Settings
Enable Private DNS Names for the endpoint if required. This allows services in the DevOps VPC to resolve the service's DNS name to the private endpoint.
5. Update Route Tables and Security Groups
Ensure the route table in the DevOps VPC allows traffic to the VPC endpoint.
Update the SharedServices account’s endpoint security group to allow traffic from the DevOps VPC CIDR range.
6. Configure IAM Permissions
Grant IAM permissions in both accounts to allow the necessary actions:
In the SharedServices account, allow the DevOps account IAM roles/users to connect to the endpoint.
In the DevOps account, allow IAM roles/users to initiate requests to the service.
Example Policy: SharedServices Account
Attach this policy to the VPC Endpoint Service to allow access from the DevOps account:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<DevOps-Account-ID>:root"
      },
      "Action": "ec2:Connect"
    }
  ]
}
Example Policy: DevOps Account
Attach this policy to the IAM role or user in the DevOps account to allow connection to the endpoint:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:CreateVpcEndpoint",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Troubleshooting
Service Name Resolution: Ensure the Private DNS Names are correctly configured for the endpoint in the DevOps account.
Security Groups: Verify that the security groups in both accounts allow necessary traffic.
Cross-Account Permissions: Confirm IAM permissions for the shared service and connecting resources.
This setup establishes a private, secure connection between the two accounts, leveraging AWS PrivateLink and VPC Endpoints. Let me know if you need more detailed guidance!

Is "4. Configure DNS Settings" in the previous response done in the NIAC AWS DevOps Account or the CCOE Shared Services AWS Account?

The step "4. Configure DNS Settings" for enabling Private DNS Names is primarily done in the CCoE Shared Services AWS Account, where the VPC Endpoint Service is created.

Here's a breakdown of the responsibilities for DNS configuration:

DNS Configuration in CCoE Shared Services AWS Account
Enable Private DNS:

While creating the VPC Endpoint Service in the SharedServices account, ensure that the Private DNS Names feature is enabled. This allows AWS to create and manage private DNS entries for the service in the consuming VPCs.
DNS Zone Management (if applicable):

If a custom DNS name is required for the service, you may need to configure a Route 53 private hosted zone associated with the SharedServices VPC.
DNS Configuration in NIAC DevOps AWS Account
In the DevOps account, ensure the following:

Private DNS Resolution:

While creating the VPC Interface Endpoint, enable Private DNS Names in the DevOps account to automatically resolve the service name to the private IP address of the endpoint.
Custom DNS Considerations:

If the service uses a custom DNS name from a private hosted zone in the SharedServices account, the DevOps account will need appropriate permissions to associate its VPC with that Route 53 private hosted zone.
Final Notes
Where DNS Resolution Happens: The DevOps account resolves the private DNS names for the service, but the configuration to enable Private DNS is controlled in the SharedServices account.
Custom DNS Names: If custom DNS is needed, collaboration between both accounts (e.g., Route 53 configurations) may be required.

Accessing an AWS PrivateLink in a SharedServices AWS Account from a DevOps AWS Account involves creating a VPC Endpoint Service in the SharedServices account and consuming it through a VPC Interface Endpoint in the DevOps account. Here's how to set it up step by step:

Steps to Access AWS PrivateLink Across Accounts
1. Set Up the PrivateLink Service in the SharedServices AWS Account
Deploy the Service (if applicable):

If you’re hosting your application or service behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) in the SharedServices VPC, make sure the NLB is configured to listen on the desired ports.
Create a VPC Endpoint Service:

Navigate to VPC > Endpoint Services in the AWS Management Console.
Create a new Endpoint Service.
Select the Network Load Balancer associated with your service.
Enable Acceptance Required (optional), which requires consumers to request and await approval to use the endpoint.
Add permissions for the DevOps AWS Account to access the service by specifying the account ID.
Example: Add the following principal permission:

json
Copy code
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<DevOps-Account-ID>:root"
  },
  "Action": "ec2:Connect"
}
Get the Service Name:

Once the endpoint service is created, note its Service Name, which looks like:
php
Copy code
com.amazonaws.vpce.<region>.vpce-svc-xxxxxxxxxxxx
2. Set Up the Interface Endpoint in the DevOps AWS Account
Create a VPC Interface Endpoint:

In the DevOps AWS account, navigate to VPC > Endpoints.
Click Create Endpoint and choose Find Service by Name.
Enter the Service Name provided by the SharedServices account.
Associate the Endpoint with Subnets and Security Groups:

Select the subnets where the endpoint will be accessible.
Attach a security group that allows traffic from your resources (e.g., EC2 instances) to the endpoint.
DNS Settings:

Enable Private DNS to allow seamless resolution of the service name to the private IP address of the endpoint.
3. Update Security Groups and Permissions
SharedServices Account:

Update the Network Load Balancer's security group to allow inbound traffic from the DevOps VPC CIDR range or specific resources.
DevOps Account:

Ensure the security group attached to the VPC endpoint allows outbound traffic to the endpoint's private IP addresses.
4. Verify Connectivity
Use tools like curl or telnet to test connectivity from the DevOps account to the service.
Example:
bash
Copy code
curl -X GET https://<service-name>.<region>.amazonaws.com
Example Scenario
SharedServices Account:
Hosted Service: A custom application on EC2 behind an NLB.
VPC Endpoint Service Name: com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0123456789abcdef.
DevOps Account:
VPC Interface Endpoint: Connects to the service using the Service Name.
Private DNS Enabled: Resolves requests to the endpoint's private IP.
Troubleshooting Tips
DNS Resolution Issues:

Ensure Private DNS is enabled in the DevOps account.
Verify route tables in the DevOps VPC include the VPC endpoint.
Connectivity Issues:

Check security groups on both the SharedServices NLB and the DevOps endpoint.
Confirm the SharedServices account has granted permission for the DevOps account.
Service Acceptance:

If Acceptance Required is enabled, the DevOps account must send a request, and the SharedServices account must approve it.
