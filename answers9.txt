Accessing an AWS VPC Endpoint in a SharedServices AWS account from a DevOps AWS account involves setting up cross-account access through AWS PrivateLink. Here's how you can achieve this:

Steps to Access a Shared VPC Endpoint
1. Create the VPC Endpoint in the SharedServices Account
In the SharedServices AWS account:
Create a VPC Endpoint (an Interface Endpoint) in the relevant VPC.
Associate the endpoint with subnets in the VPC where your resources reside.
Ensure the security group for the endpoint allows inbound traffic from the DevOps VPC.
2. Create a PrivateLink Service in SharedServices
In the SharedServices account, expose the endpoint as a VPC Endpoint Service:
Go to VPC > Endpoint Services.
Create a new Endpoint Service and associate it with the Network Load Balancer (NLB) or service running in the VPC.
Enable Allow principals and specify the DevOps account ID to allow access.
3. Create a VPC Endpoint in the DevOps Account
In the DevOps AWS account:
Go to VPC > Endpoints.
Create a new Interface Endpoint.
Specify the Service Name of the VPC Endpoint Service in the SharedServices account. The Service Name is typically in the format:
php
Copy code
com.amazonaws.vpce.<region>.vpce-svc-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Choose the subnets and security groups to associate with this endpoint in the DevOps VPC.
4. Configure DNS Settings
Enable Private DNS Names for the endpoint if required. This allows services in the DevOps VPC to resolve the service's DNS name to the private endpoint.
5. Update Route Tables and Security Groups
Ensure the route table in the DevOps VPC allows traffic to the VPC endpoint.
Update the SharedServices accountâ€™s endpoint security group to allow traffic from the DevOps VPC CIDR range.
6. Configure IAM Permissions
Grant IAM permissions in both accounts to allow the necessary actions:
In the SharedServices account, allow the DevOps account IAM roles/users to connect to the endpoint.
In the DevOps account, allow IAM roles/users to initiate requests to the service.
Example Policy: SharedServices Account
Attach this policy to the VPC Endpoint Service to allow access from the DevOps account:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<DevOps-Account-ID>:root"
      },
      "Action": "ec2:Connect"
    }
  ]
}
Example Policy: DevOps Account
Attach this policy to the IAM role or user in the DevOps account to allow connection to the endpoint:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:CreateVpcEndpoint",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Troubleshooting
Service Name Resolution: Ensure the Private DNS Names are correctly configured for the endpoint in the DevOps account.
Security Groups: Verify that the security groups in both accounts allow necessary traffic.
Cross-Account Permissions: Confirm IAM permissions for the shared service and connecting resources.
This setup establishes a private, secure connection between the two accounts, leveraging AWS PrivateLink and VPC Endpoints. Let me know if you need more detailed guidance!
